# What is the Ops Dojo?

It's a meta project for developing a shared lexicon, best practices and example
projects for running technical operations and development.

# Project layout

- Product/
  - Where the output of this initiative goes
  - the-library/ - The collection of definitions, advice and tools we are developing.

- Program/
  - Management docs for this Program: definitions, scope, etc
  - Also serves as the first example application of the library to a project
  - archive/ - Some older stuff which needs to be incorporated and deleted

- Examples/
  - Instances of projects or programs using this library

# The Plan

## Four Prong Attack

### Lexicon

- Customer
  - Vendor
  - Service
    - Demand
    - Delivery
    - ServiceLevel
    - ServiceLevelFailure

- Program
  - Project
  - Process
  - InviolableTriangle
    - Scope
    - Resources
    - DeliveryDate

- Operations

### Best Practices

How the objects in the Lexicon interact.

- A Vendor provides Services to Customers
  - The Vendor executes a Program to identify its Customers

### TIC Tool Suite

https://github.com/rdeforest/TIC

As of 2012-02-02, this is jut a stub.

### Example Projects

- Most if not all terms in the Lexicon should apply to one or more entities in
  the examples.

## Principles

- The development of Ops Dojo itself will be guided by its own wisdom to the
  degree that doing so is possible. It will itself constitute another example.
