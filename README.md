# What is the Ops Dojo?

## Mission Statement

The Ops Dojo serves humanity by gathering, absorbing, developing and
disseminating wisdom, knowledge and tools which promote balanced, continuously
improving processes.

## In other words

This is primarily a meta project for developing a shared lexicon, best
practices, tools and examples to improve technical operations. Most of what
this project produces will likely be applicable to life in general, which is
why the Mission Statement is as generic as it is. There's no reason to
prematurely limit ourselves.

# The Plan

## Four Prong Attack

### Lexicon

- Customer
  - Vendor
  - Service
    - Demand
    - Delivery
    - ServiceLevel
    - ServiceLevelFailure

- Program
  - Project
  - Process
  - InviolableTriangle
    - Scope
    - Resources
    - DeliveryDate

- Operations

### Best Practices

How the objects in the Lexicon interact.

- A Vendor provides Services to Customers
  - The Vendor executes a Program to identify its Customers

### TIC Tool Suite

### Example Projects

- Most if not all terms in the Lexicon should apply to one or more entities in
  the examples.

## Principles

- The development of Ops Dojo itself will be guided by its own wisdom to the
  degree that doing so is possible. It will itself constitute another example.
