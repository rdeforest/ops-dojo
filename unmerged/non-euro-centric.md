Nicole and I have been talking tonight (2016-04-04) about the problem of
euro-centrism in IT. We are discussing the idea of re-developing EVERYTHING
with an eye towards de-centralization.

# Everything?

Everything.

  - New hardware ISA with 32-bit words to accomodate UTF-32 and to simplify
    other things.
  - New programming languages designed with help from linguists to be
    inclusive to non-English speakers.
    - Afore-mentioned ISA guided by wisdom and assumptions from more cultures.
    - Assembly
    - C-level (macro assembly)
    - Tools and documentaiton
