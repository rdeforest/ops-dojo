# Less Is More

Apply the Unix philosophy whenever possible. Build small simple components up
into larger simple components. At any level of the tree, a given node should
be simple enough to explain on a napkin or in under 10 minutes. If the
explanation of a module depends on a complete understanding of its constituant
modules, it is insufficiently decoupled from them.
