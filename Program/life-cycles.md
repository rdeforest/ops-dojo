# Birth, Growth, Death

Everything has a life-cycle. Everything that ever was has a time before which
it wasn't. Nothing lasts forever. Between these is a period of existence which
has its own inner cycles. 

In the interest of breaking things down into and decoupling their constituant
parts we break down the life cycle of all things this way. This allows us to
focus on each phase as well as to ensure we have given all the phases
sufficient attention.

Each phase has parameters which contribute the value of the entity in
question. This document attempts to catalog and describe those parameters.

## Birth

The Birth phase of the generic life-cycle has a life-cycle of its own.

### Definition

The definition phase is a negotiation between participants about what is to be
created. The details of the definition depend on the nature of the entity. For
a Project or Program, elements such as Mission and Scope are part of the
Definition. For Products and Services the definition includes the relevant
protocols and such.

### Preparation

Preparation is everything that can be done before committing "substantial"
resources.

### Initiation

This phase starts with the "go/no-go" phase of beginning the Growth phase.

## Growth

## Death

Also known as retirement, decommissioning, sun-setting, etc. We refer to it as
Death here to maintain a consistent degree of abstraction.

Everything ends, even if its end takes the form of transformation into or
obsolecense by something new. Intentionally planning for and executing the
Death phase helps minimize unintended consequences.

The Death phase has the following components:

### Description of Death Causes

An entity's life-cycle may be intentionally concluded when circumstances no
longer justify its continuation, or it may be concluded of necessity when
circumstances will no longer sustain the entity. The effort spent identiying
the details of such consequences will help inform the plans you develop for
its conclusion.

### Planning

For each termination reason you identify, there will be better and worse way
of concluding the life-cycle. For example, when planning to eat lunch, 

# Example: Lunch

## Birth

It's 14:00, I haven't eaten yet and I have a couple of hours to spare. I'm
even a little bit hungry.

### Definition

This Lunch entity will be successful if, 
- by 15:55 
- I have consumed a sufficiently nourishing and filling meal 
- I have spent less than $20
- I am back at my place of work
- None of the constraints of my other cycles are violated (safety and such)

### Preparation

- Deciding what/where to eat
- Communicating plans to those who might care
- Posting notice of absence if necessary
- Getting to the lunch site

### Initiation

- Ordering meal
- Receiving meal

## Growth

## Death

### Causes of death

- Ran out of time
- Interruption (fire in the disco)
- Ran out of food (finished eating)
- No longer hungry

### Death plans

- Goals
  - Bill settled
  - Belongings gathered
