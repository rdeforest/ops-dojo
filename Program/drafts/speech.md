All of you are probably familiar with the expression 

    "those who can, do; those who can't, teach"

There is some truth to it, but not as a condemnation. Within any given field,
what makes a person good in that field is different from what makes them good
at helping others improve in that field.

My goals are to help you

  - find your strengths and passions
  - visualize a path to your ideal project's end
  - learn the skills and habits you will rely on to follow that path
