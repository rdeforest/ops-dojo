# Concerns

- There's a lot of material to cover. How to keep it interesting and coherent?
- Practical exercises
  - use it or lose it
  - Exercises have to be
    - fun and/or relevant
    - short
    - challenging/engaging but not frustrating

# Todo

## Kellie

- Get her a way to tinker on her terms
 - Sharing Mianna's laptop won't work
 - Maybe recussitate my Yoga 3?
 - Maybe give her my machine and get myself a new laptop?
  - too generous?

## Mianna

- Re-assess interest

## Either or both

- Present the landscape
 - History, motivation
  - "by humans, for humans"
  - sources of complexity
   - greed, stupidity
   - mistakes
   - new information

 - Contexts/Domains
  - Meta: talking about the lessons, learning, etc
  - Non-technical/tangential
   - Project/program management
  - Abstract
   - Math
   - Protocols
   - Design patterns
   - The seven-layer-burrito
  - Concrete Layers and Their Protocols
   - Program and library layouts
   - Package systems
   - Human interfaces (WIMP, emoji, Vim, ...)
   - Network layers
